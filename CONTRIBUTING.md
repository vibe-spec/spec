# Contributing to .vibe Specification

Thank you for considering contributing to the .vibe specification!  
We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug reports, clarifications, new examples, translations, or even proposals for new semantic symbols.

## How Can I Contribute?

### 📝 Reporting Issues

- If you find a typo, unclear wording, or a bug in the specification, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vibe-spec/spec/issues).
- Use a clear title and describe the problem or suggestion in detail.

### 💡 Suggesting Enhancements

- Have an idea for a new symbol or a better way to express something? Open an issue with the label `enhancement`.
- Explain the use case and why the current syntax falls short. New symbols must follow the design principles: **minimal, Markdown‑native, and optional**.

### 📁 Adding Examples

- Examples are vital for showing how .vibe works in practice.
- Place your `.vibe` file in the `examples/` directory.
- Include a short comment at the top explaining what the example demonstrates.
- Submit a pull request.

### 🌐 Translating

- We’d love to have the specification available in more languages.
- If you want to add a translation, copy `docs/spec/v0.1.md` to `docs/spec/v0.1.xx.md` (where `xx` is your language code, e.g. `fr`, `ja`).
- Translate the content, keeping the structure and formatting identical.
- Open a pull request.

### 🔧 Proposing Changes to the Specification

- Changes to the core specification are carefully reviewed. Please open an issue first to discuss your proposal.
- Once consensus is reached, you can submit a pull request with the changes.
- All changes must be **backward compatible** and follow the **progressive enhancement** principle.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
- Keep your changes focused – one pull request per feature or fix.
- Update the documentation if your change affects it.
- Ensure your Markdown is valid (you can use a linter).
- In your pull request description, explain what you changed and why.
